Website Creation Brief – For WordPress Development

Title: KavinoRa
Platform: WordPress
Purpose: Build a clean, mobile-first, fast-loading, scalable e-commerce website for the brand KavinoRa, starting with a single hero product and expanding later to multiple wellness/self-care products. The site must be WooCommerce-ready and SEO-optimized, with a professional user interface, minimal design, and strong branding presence.



Website Summary (For Developer/AI Tool)

Hi! I want you to create a fully functional, modern, and professional WordPress website for my brand KavinoRa. It should have a clean, elegant design that reflects our identity as a wellness brand focused on comfort, confidence, and simplicity. Our first product is a plant-based anti-chafing spray called KavinoRa MotionMist™, designed for runners, athletes, and active individuals. The site will initially focus on this single product but must be designed in a way that supports multiple products in the future using WooCommerce.

The website should run on WordPress, using Elementor as the page builder and a lightweight, responsive theme such as Astra, Kadence, or Blocksy. It must be mobile-optimized, load fast, and be easy to update. I want full ownership and access to edit pages in the future.
